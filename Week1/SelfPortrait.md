Coding the first assignemnt for Interactive Media was a delight! I had a great time exploring the freedom to make a self portrait in any way i want! I chose to go for something artsy and abstract using triangles!

I started with my scrap paper and had a single triangle on it - whigh was placed at an agle to give it some depth. Then I tried to give it more definition by adding more triangles. It went from one, to three to all the triangles you see in the final piece. Finally, I removed the basic triangles which I used as a template for the facial structure. 

After I Finished the facial structure with triangles, I found 3 significant skin tones to give the face depth and shade. On that I added the lips for my portrait, and then finished the piece by adding a pair of glasses. 

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my piece although I could have definitely improved it by adding more depth and detail by using more shades of colours and triangles.
