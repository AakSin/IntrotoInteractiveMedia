### Objective 

To create a simple, but elegant computer generated piece using loops.

### Process 

Before I started working on this piece, I was extremely fascinated by the usage of Perlin Noise. Even before I knew of its existence, I felt the need for a more uniform random - and perlin noise was the answer! 

While experimenting with the perlin wave, I thought of plotting a circular perlin noise rather than just a linear one, and from there came my idea of a rose. I achieved that by transforming my playground to use polar coordinates rather than the cartesian. I realized how analogous this simple plot was to that of anything formed in nature. I turned this from just a circular plot, to that of a spiral that opened outwards. By allowing the piece to run for a few iterations, I found myself looking at a beautiful flower, which had a unique petal structure every time the program ran. I changed t the colour to red and made the spiral run infinitely by making the point restart whevener it went out of scope. 

As a result, I had an artistic rose - simple yet elegant - like the one grows using Nature's code. 

### Future Improvements

The piece can be further developed by making the petals move - maybe by using a 2D perlin noise. Althought this might be a challenging task, I can imagine it would look mesmerizing.
