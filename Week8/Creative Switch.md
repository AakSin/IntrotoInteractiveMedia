### Objective 

To create a creative switch using arduino and a breadboard. 

### Process 

This was a really fun activity to do. Even completing the circuit and watching the LED light up brings out the 4th grader on me. 

For this assignment, I used a banana. I was specifically interested in the electrical conductivity of organic substances. The idea came to my mind when I was holding both ends of the open circuit and the LED dimly lit up. I tried placing both ends of the cables on my tongue (*do not try this at home*), and the results were much better. In addition to the lights being brighter than before due to the conductivity of our saliva, I could feel a metallic taste whenever current flowed through! This was possibly because ions were released from the metal when current passed. 

Finally, for a safe demostration and completing this assignemnt, I grabbed tomorrow breakfast, a banana! I tried a little experimentation. Connecting the cables closer on one end, and connecting them farther apart on the opposite ends of the banana. I was hoping the lights would be dimmer due to the increased distance (and hence higher resistance), but biology never fails to surprise you. 
 

### Future Improvements

I can think of a lot of ways to improve or have fun with this project.

One, would be to experiment with everything organic I can find to see whats the most conductive.
