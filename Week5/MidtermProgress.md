# Orbital Sandbox Simulator - Mid-Term Project

## Inspiration 

back in 2007, the first games I ever played were on [Cool Math Games](https://www.coolmathgames.com/). The website used to come up with new games every week or so, adding on to a never ending collection of flash player games (which has now been discontinued). My favourite ones were the ones where some level of physics was involved, and it was in fact the source of my interest in the subject of physics as it gave me an unlimited playground to test out my imagination. 

For that reason, I chose to make a physics simulation based game - an orbit simulator! The game does not have an objective - other than that of testing out your imagination and have fun! 

## Concept

The game uses the Universal Law of Gravitation and other related Laws of Motion for its physics. It will be tweaked to make the game user friendly - in terms of the ratio of sizes, masses and force applied. 
The game expects to have multiple bodies which are given a mass, radius and an initial velocity by the user. The bodies simulate gravity and 


## Development
### Initial Attempt 

I first started by trying to figure out the Physics. The Physics of attraction and gravity requires the use of vectors. 
I found the following videos by The Coding Train to be immensly useful for understand how displacement, vectors and acceetarion works :

  - [Gravitataion Attraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpgB3cNhKPM&t=522s)


### Current progress

I'm currently trying to implement attraction and
