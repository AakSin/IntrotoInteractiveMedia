### Objective 

To create a code generated art piece using OOP in p5js

### Process 

Like the previous week's piece, I wanted to use Perlin Noise again. But, along with using perlin noise I had to complete the objective of using OOP in my code. So I ended up making bubbles in an ocean, where each bubble is an object and its size and color follows a perlin noise. 

### Challenges
I faced a challenge when it came to applying the perlin noise in a way that the surface looks consistent with every frame. It was solved by using a 3D perlin noise as the surface takes the perlin values from the cross-section with every frame. This made the transitions for the bubbles smoother. 

### Future Improvements

The artwork can be improved by changing the way the perlin noise affects the colour gradient. Maybe overlapping of bubbles - rather than sticking to the grid will make a more realistic image.
